# MemoryShell / メモリーシェル
Learn with every execution of your shell

## Why?
I was looking for the best solution for me for learning japanese characters and words. Since I started using linux I spend all day in terminal, so I came up with idea with answering one question with every start of shell.

## Installation
Just use ``./install.sh`` or put it in your zshrc (or other shell) manually

## Usage
- first arg is for question
- second arg is for answers
- if third arg is set to 0 you have to reply for question, otherwise you can just see the answer

Example:
```
memoryshell.sh ./data/hiragana_questions.txt ./data/hiragana_answers 0
```
